Delays in Ordering: Manual order-taking can lead to long waiting times.

Order Errors: Miscommunication during manual processes often results in incorrect orders.

Limited Accessibility: Customers rely on servers to bring menus and take orders, causing inconvenience.

Hygiene Concerns: Traditional systems lack a contactless solution, which is especially important in the current health-conscious world.

Solution: Our QR Code-Based Food Ordering System provides a fast, error-free, and contactless way for customers to access menus and place orders, improving efficiency and enhancing the dining experience.

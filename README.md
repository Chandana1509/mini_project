The traditional method of ordering food in restaurants often involves manual interaction between customers and servers, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This process may lead to inefficiencies such as:

Time Delays: Customers might need to wait for a server to take their orders during busy hours, resulting in long wait times.

Order Errors: Miscommunication or human error during manual order-taking can lead to incorrect orders, causing dissatisfaction.

To address these issues, the QR Code-Based Food Ordering System aims to streamline the food ordering process by leveraging technology. This system enables customers to access digital menus, place orders, and customize preferences using their smartphones by scanning a QR code.
By implementing this system, restaurants can improve operational efficiency, enhance customer experience, and minimize human errors in order-taking.
